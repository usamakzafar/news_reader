    <string name="my_message">Hello PropertyGuru! \n\nI\'ve made this app in the most native way possible, using only basic Java and Android methods.
        No Library is being used for making the REST API calls. This is the most basic that I could have made it. Usually I would like
        to use helping libraries like GSON and Volley for handling these REST calls and their JSON response.
        Anyhow, it has been a good revision of my skills. Hope to hear from you soon! \n\nUsama K. Zafar</string>
